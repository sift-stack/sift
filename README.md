# Sift Protobufs

This repository contains protobufs (protocol buffers) for clients of Sift to interact directly with our gRPC service. If certain protobufs are not yet available for a particular API, please refer to the documentation for our
[REST API](https://docs.siftstack.com/api-docs/rest) which may expose those services via gRPC gateway.

For manual installation instructions and usage examples for various languages please refer to the [examples](examples/) directory. If there aren't instructions for your particular programming language consider one of the following options:
- Request for the Sift team to include instructions for your language of choice. Keep in mind that there are varying degrees of support for each language throughout the protobuf ecosystem. Depending on the language, support might be totally unavailable.
- Compile the protobufs manually.
- Use our [REST API](https://docs.siftstack.com/api-docs/rest).

In the near future we will provide more installation options.
