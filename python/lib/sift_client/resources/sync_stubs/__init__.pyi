    High-level API for interacting with assets.

    This class provides a Pythonic, notebook-friendly interface for interacting with the AssetsAPI.
    It handles automatic handling of gRPC services, seamless type conversion, and clear error handling.

    All methods in this class use the Asset class from the low-level wrapper, which is a user-friendly
    representation of an asset using standard Python data structures and types.
