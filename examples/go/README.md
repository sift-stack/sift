# Sift Go Example

Before proceeding with installation, you will need to ensure that you have the [buf CLI](https://buf.build/docs/installation) installed.

If `$ which buf` generates a path to the executable, you may proceed to the installation steps.

To install Sift protobufs in your project:

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine and `cd` into it:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sift-stack/sift
$ cd sift
```

2. Assuming the path to the root of your Go project is `$PROJECT_DIR`, run the following command in the `sift` directory that you just cloned:

```bash
$ buf export protos --output=$PROJECT_DIR/protos --config protos/buf.yaml
```

The Sift protos can and its imports can now be found in your `$PROJECT_DIR/protos` directory.

3. Copy the `buf` template for Go to your project directory:

```bash
$ cp buf_templates/buf.gen.go.yaml $PROJECT_DIR/buf.gen.yaml
```

4. `cd` into your Go project at `$PROJECT_DIR`.

5. Once inside of your Go project, you'll need to modify the `managed.enabled.go_package_prefix.default` value of your `buf.gen.yaml` file to
have the package prefix named after your Go module. If our Go module's name, for example, is `github.com/sift-go-cli`, then change the `buf.gen.yaml` to `github.com/sift-go-cli/gen/protos/go`. Your
`buf.gen.yaml` should now look like the following:

```yaml
version: v1
managed:
  enabled: true
  go_package_prefix:
    default: "github.com/sift-go-cli/gen/protos/go"
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.28.1
    out: gen/protos/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: go-vtproto
    out: gen/protos/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/protos/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

Refer to your `go.mod` file for the name of your Go module.

6. Inside of the root of your project directory you may now compile your protobufs:

```bash
$ buf generate protos
```

Your project up to this point should look like the following (full depth not shown):

```
 sift-go-cli
 ├─ buf.gen.yaml
 ├─ gen
 │  └─ protos
 │     └─ go
 ├─ go.sum
 ├─ go.mod
 └─ protos
    ├─ protoc-gen-openapiv2
    │  └─ options
    ├─ google
    │  └─ api
    └─ sift
       ├─ runs
       ├─ notifications
       ├─ annotations
       ├─ users
       ├─ common
       ├─ assets
       ├─ tags
       └─ annotation_logs
```

7. Install any dependencies you might be missing that the generated code requires:

```bash
$ go get -d ./...
```

8. Now your project should be ready to use the generated Go code to interact with Sift's gRPC API. Please refer to the example code for usage.
If you are cloning the example repository, be sure to `$ cp .example.env .env` and set the appropriate variables. Comments in the `.example.env` files
may prove useful.
